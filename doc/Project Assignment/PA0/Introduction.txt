HangOutExact
As being teenagers, our team know that it is sometimes hard to organize a good hangout plan for a group such as
finding attractive places, what to play, where to eat, or even just stay at home.
First, one will initialize a plan by giving us some general information, then our system 
will provide users suggested places based on the data given for the
users to choose. After that, their friends will join in the group and everyone can have a chat
together to change the place or quit the group. And the plan will terminate if no one join anymore.
Moreover, weather also contributes a signicant role in a plan, the application will consequently
suggest an alternative plan to changing from playing soccer to board game if the weather is bad for example.
Therefore, our team find its necessary to propose an idea of an application to help users find a best strategy to
follow their hangout plan. 

Potential Users: teenagers, mobile phone users (android device)

Environment: android

 1) Create and store a list of locations
 (used to represent a 'hangout')
 2) search hangout
 (accordance with criteria given by the users, e.g: including eat, drink; or indoor only, suitable for 5 people, etc.)
 3) Weather forecast (using APIs)
 (for example hangout is planned at 3pm, but it would be raining at 3, so application will raise a warning at time of planning
 it also display suggestion, e.g: it would stop raining at 5pm, do you want to move the schedule)?
 4) community usage of the application
